## wbec adapter for ioBroker

Integration of Heidelberg WallBox Energy Control ESP8266

## Description

The **ioBroker WBEC Adapter** allows you to regularly monitor and control the state of your WBEC Controller. This adapter provides the capability to query the controller at a configurable interval and to interact with certain important states. For example, you can monitor charging power and directly adjust the configuration for PV surplus charging.

## Features

- **Regular Queries**: The adapter queries the state of the WBEC Controller at an interval you specify, ensuring that you always have up-to-date information on its status.
- **Writable States**: You can directly adjust certain parameters, such as charging power and the configuration for PV surplus charging, through the ioBroker interface.
